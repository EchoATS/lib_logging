implementation of ``printf()``.  It also provides a framework for compile-time
control of which debug messages are enabled.

Required hardware
=================

The example code provided with the application has been implemented
and tested on the XK-EVK-XU316 xcore.ai evaluation kit.

Prerequisites
=============

 * This document assumes familiarity with the XMOS xCORE architecture,
   the XMOS tool chain and the xC language. Documentation related to these
   aspects which are not specific to this application note are linked to in
